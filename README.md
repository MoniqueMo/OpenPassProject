 Project 1: OpenPass
This project is to design an app for finding the events that will take place in the US.
The events include sports, concerts, plays, opera, and broad way shows. This app allows the users to find the event and purchase the ticket. The app also allows the users to look for 
restaurant nearby and provides the address and telephone number for the user to make a reservation.
This app is named OpenPass. It utilizes the following API:

    * Ticket Master
    * Yelp.

## Physical Layout of OpenPass
The layout of this application composed of 4 sections:

    1. NAVBAR
    2. Title and background
    3. Search engine
    4. Table of results.

## Methodology
This application is based on the following methodologies:

    * 10 Usability Heuristic for User Interface Design, Nielsen (1995)
    * Contextual inquiry which is a user-centered design (UCD) research method, part of the Contextual design Methodology
    * Iterative design in which the designers work in a series of stages and improving the design each time.
